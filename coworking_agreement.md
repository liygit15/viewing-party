# Coworking Agreement

Talk through each section with your partner. Add notes on what you discussed and agreed upon in each section. At the bottom, type your names to sign off on your agreement.

## Accessibility Needs
*What does each team member need access to in order to succeed and show up the best they can?*

Zoom, Slack, In-Class Coworking Sessions (even the optional ones),github account, github collaboration access(one forks and invites others,others join.), vscode live sharing

## Collaboration vs. Individual Work Expectations
*Clarify your collaboration expectations - does your group want to write code together all of the time? Or divide work to do independently, then come together to share accomplishments? What tools and technologies can help your collaboration?*

We will assign functions to write during our coworking sessions on Zoom, write our code individually, then review and debug our code together during the following coworking session. We will keep eachother updated via Slack, sending messages when we complete our function(s) or if we run across any issues along the way. We won't complete what we haven't previously discussed.

These tools maybe helpful:slack,zoom,github collaboration access, vscode live code sharing.

## Learning Style
*How does each team member learn best in project settings?*

(Madi) Through open communication, pseudocode, working through problems independently, and discussing ways to improve and merge solutions.
(Li Yan) We analyze the project goals together, then divide the tasks into different functions to think through and write code independently. After that, we merge everything together and have discussions. If there are conflicts, we discuss the best solution.So we can not only have solutions independently but also learn from each other.

## Preferred Feedback Style
*How does each team member best receive feedback?*

(Madi) Clear, straightforward communication. Non-ambiguous expectation-setting.
(Li Yan) I like timely and direct feedback, and we can communicate anytime on Slack.

## One Team Communication Skill to Improve
*What is a teamwork-related skill you want to work on?*

(Madi) Talking through code and coding with other people. Explaining reasoning and ways to make changes in the moment.
(Li Yan) We can communicate a lot, explain our code to others,so we can have a better understanding of our code,also practice our expression.

## Optional: Other agreements
*Other co-working agreements that were not captured in the above sections.*
