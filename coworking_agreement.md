# Coworking Agreement

Talk through each section with your partner. Add notes on what you discussed and agreed upon in each section. At the bottom, type your names to sign off on your agreement.

## Accessibility Needs
*What does each team member need access to in order to succeed and show up the best they can?*

Zoom, Slack, In-Class Coworking Sessions (even the optional ones)

## Collaboration vs. Individual Work Expectations
*Clarify your collaboration expectations - does your group want to write code together all of the time? Or divide work to do independently, then come together to share accomplishments? What tools and technologies can help your collaboration?*

We will assign functions to write during our coworking sessions on Zoom, write our code individually, then review and debug our code together during the following coworking session. We will keep eachother updated via Slack, sending messages when we complete our function(s) or if we run across any issues along the way. We won't complete what we haven't previously discussed.

## Learning Style
*How does each team member learn best in project settings?*

(Madi) Through open communication, pseudocode, working through problems independently, and discussing ways to improve and merge solutions.

## Preferred Feedback Style
*How does each team member best receive feedback?*

(Madi) Clear, straightforward communication. Non-ambiguous expectation-setting.

## One Team Communication Skill to Improve
*What is a teamwork-related skill you want to work on?*
